The day has come for our final presentation.

## Rushing
Just yesterday, I started to rush on the map feature that should have had already been impremented. The main issues were that there were limited open source maps out there and documentations on existing ones are poorly written.

![MapBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapbox)
## Life saviour
Luckily mapbox came to my rescue, the api was easy to use and the different layers were easy to implement, within a few clicks, I had managed to upload the map to where it is required.

## Last minute tweaks
So instead of two seperate sites in the format of a microsite, we had decided for everything to be integrated and the different categories were to be in the same page. This meant that everything was easily accessed within the header.
