## TL;DR
Starting work on the separation mechanism.

## Officially Starting
Last Friday, 20/03, I finally got a confirmation and a thumbs up to start on this Lego part sorter project. This was just in time for my project charter but not enough time for us to come up with a full plan. Instead, we drafted out a rough [introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/school/2020/03/27/lpsseperate/){:target="_blank"}.

## Original Plan
Earlier in our project charter, we had planned to start on the scanning portion. However, the plan was to use the [HuskyLens](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1371216747/huskylens-an-ai-camera-click-learn-and-play){:target="_blank"} but we had yet to receive it. To help save time, we sheduled the scanning to be done at a later time and pushed forward the seperation to be done first.

## Starting work on the seperation
In order to save time, we needed to come up with a quick prototpype to test out our design ideas. Our prototype started out with using Lego parts since we had an abundance of them.
