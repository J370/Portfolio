# 大工落成！
Finally, after a full day of work, I managed to merge both my blog and portfolio into one individual site. This move would provide convenience when it comes to editing code.

## Ought to be done
With two different jekyll themes having to be managed seperately, sooner or later, there's would come a time when I need to tidy everything up. This is especially so given that I am managing both sites and it does not make sense having to keep the two of them seperate. Nonetheless, I keep putting this off due to how challenging it might be. At the same time, there are existing issues on both sites that I need to clean up. Most of these changes are under the hood and involve back end code.

However, as the mess started to pile up, I decided to set aside time to fix it before it gets even worse. Once I started on it, there was no stopping. Imagine if the two sites were combined halfway through. I do not dare think about it. So it's either I give up and revert everything or push on and make sure that the integration is done.
