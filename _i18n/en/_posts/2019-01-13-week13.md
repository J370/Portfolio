Change in the design.

This week, we carried on with the aesthetics of the applications. This includes the implementation of a navigation drawer that slides open from the left. Through this drawer, users are given the ability to choose to view the different aspects of our application.

Additionally, we had been working on getting the AI to work through the use of Google's Tensorflow lite API.
