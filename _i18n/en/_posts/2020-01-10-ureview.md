And another big change...

## Time for brainstorming
After our previous hackathon, we had gathered the feedback that was given to us. Right now, we will be working on a review site to further include other categories namely food. At the same time, we had decided to change the way our review site is portrayed. Instead of being unBiased, it will be ammended to uReviews.

## "Reviews are biased"
One of the main reasons is that reviews are naturally biased. Take for example the reviews that we see online are similar in phrasing to "this thing is bad", "I really liked this". While the reviews might be authentic, what we are really stiving for is along the lines of "this is bad because... it can be improved through" as well as "I like this but this area could have had been better". This form of reviews provides a more objective, two sided view that we are looking for.

## Technical Aspects
With the new goals in mind, we need to mainly focus on the way the database should be structured along with how the flask server should be configured to handle any redirects. At the same time, the AI now needs to cater to a larger variety of reviews.
