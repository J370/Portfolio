Progress in implementing the app usage.

The app usage statistics is one of the key portions of the application as it provides users with a graphical representation of individual app usage that the user uses. Here, the icon of the application as well as it's package name is displayed. Additionally, underneath the application shows the last time in which the app is used in the format of date and time.

We intend to further improve on this by showing the application name as well as time used in terms of how long it is used for. Furthermore, filters can be added to showcase certain categories of applications.
