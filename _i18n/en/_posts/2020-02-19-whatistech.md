# Quote
This is just gonna be a really quick post but I would like to share this quote from a very wise friend of mine, [Sabik]({{site.authors.Sabik.web}}){:target="_blank"}. He mentioned,
## "A pacemaker is to help keep your heart beating but not necessarily replace your heart"
and it immediately just stuck with me.

# Addiction
This was what [Sabik]({{site.authors.Sabik.web}}){:target="_blank"} said beforehand that snowballed into this conversation. These were the equally wise quotes: "I'll be honest. I think its foolish to say we should completely ditch technology since even old furniture is also technology but we shouldnt let it rule our lives or revolve around it.", "Technology is a tool". "Not a way of life".

I believe many of us had heard of this before. Indeed, technology is of great aid to us but I believe we should not over indulge in it to the point where it becomes an obstruction to our lives. Like for example, playing too much of video games that we refuse to eat or even sleep. Neither should it start to affect the lives of the people around us.

The technological revolution has always been there; just as [Sabik]({{site.authors.Sabik.web}}){:target="_blank"} had mentioned; a piece of furniture is the works of many years of experimentation and designing. It's a wonderful piece of invention that aids in our day to day life. So why when it comes to the technology "technology", we get ourselves engrossed in it, like "We cannot live without it"

And that's why I felt the quote to be more prominent and was impactful to me. All this in just a 2 minute exchange on Telegram. Hope this quote had made your day as well!
