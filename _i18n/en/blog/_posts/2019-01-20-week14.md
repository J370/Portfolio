Combination of Design and App Usage Statistics.

This week was mainly focused on adding the backend with the front end. Throughout the previous few weeks, I had been trying to merge both parts to no avail. There seems to be some compatibility issues with the API in the combination process. I am attempting to update the App Usage Statistics' API to ensure that no error is thrown.

Additionally, the continuation of implementing an AI continues. I plan on inputting data from the App Usage Statistics an add into a model which is trained on how the users use their devices. As such, the AI can then give suggestions on the different restriction levels that a user should be restricted to.
